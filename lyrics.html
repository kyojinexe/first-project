            Huh, born from the slums
            Cut from the womb had dope in my lungs
            28 grams if I wanna feel buzzed
            28 Xans if I wanna feel numb
            Fucked in the head, edge of my bed
            Glock cocked back while I pray to the dead
            If they want play, got the gang on the way
            Dial 333 for the God of the grey
            F to the I to the V to the E
            To the N to the I to the N to the E
            I'ma K to the I to the L to the L
            E-V-E-R-Y thing around me
            Turn the whip to a hearse, turn the Glock in the dirt
            Ash Wednesday into dust they return
            When they gon' learn 'bout fucking with titty
            Put 'em in a urn, roll 'em up in a Philly

            S-H-A-M-E-L-E double S
            Dollar sign, uicide, tell me who we smokin' next
            Gotta help up with a drum, better fall back
            Got a big truck rolled up with an opp pack
            Drawn first blood, bitch, I aim for the head
            Five times out of five, Five-Nine leave 'em dead
            Gonna get mine first, ain't no need for revenge
            When I shoot, it's to kill you would think I'm a vet
            Come my trigger finger itching, I'm itching the killer instinct
            Justin Timber-20-Glock, all of my bullets in sync
            Hit 'em with the left-right, switchin' gears, lead pipe
            Oh, he know do kung fu? 5.7, dead rights
            Dead lights, Pennywise, oh you just a clown, huh?
            Ground up, mixin' the blood, now he defeated
            From the ground up, straight out the mud, that's how we did it
            We the founders, drown in the flood that we created (flood)

            Damn fools on Orleans we smoke it easily
            Vampin' to the st- (Seventh Ward!)
            Throw them three's up
            59 my gang sign, slide in the Range like, "Keep up"
            All white on the inside, outside that bitch keyed up
            Scratching my nose like I'm checking the snow, bitch I'm cooler than Frieza
            Red dot made his head pop, now he just a dead opp
            Bitch I want smoke, Ruby the Tyrant
            I sit back and laugh while I make it rain ash
            Got a blade to ya throat, Ruby the Silent
            Won't say a word, just carve my name in your back
            Spit up blood as you choke, Ruby so violent
            Got choppas and ARs
            I'm 'bout to turn your fucking clique into ghosts
            Ruby defiant, my whole fucking goal is to blow up the globe
